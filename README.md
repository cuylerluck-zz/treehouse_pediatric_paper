This is the repository for the code underlying the analysis in Luck et. al, "Transcriptional fidelity enhances cancer cell line selection in pediatric cancers".

There are four items, three of which are R scripts and one of which is a text-based usage guide:

1. cuyler_rshiny_pediatrics.R -- this is the R script used to create the R shiny webpage available at pecanexplorer.org
2. ped_analysis_reviewed.R -- this is the R script used to analyze data and generate results/figures
3. ped_prep_work_reviewed.R -- this is the R script used to do data selection and cleaning prior to analysis
4. usage_guide -- this is a text-based usage guide describing how you can use the above scripts to reproduce our results with the same input data

Happy coding!
