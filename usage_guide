This is a guide for how to use the prep work and analysis R scripts in this repository.

First ensure that you have all requisite data downloaded from the proper repositories. This includes:

1. Treehouse Tumor Compendium v11 Public PolyA April 2020 clinical data
2. Treehouse Tumor Compendium v11 Public PolyA April 2020 TPM data
3. Treehouse Tumor Compendium v11 Public PolyA April 2020 expected counts data
4. Treehouse Cell Line Compendium v2 December 2019 clinical data
5. Treehouse Cell Line Compendium v2 December 2019 TPM data
6. Broad Institute CCLE Annotations file ("Cell_lines_annotations_20181226.txt")

Treehouse data is available at: https://treehousegenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/public-data/
Broad Institute data is available at: https://depmap.org/portal/download/ (go to all downloads, then search "annotations" under "file" to find it easily)

Then, open ped_prep_work_reviwed.R

Ensure you have installed all packages shown at the top (lines 1-15). Use install.packages("package") and library(package) if you need any of them.

You will need to change some directory locations depending on where you have put the downloaded files. 
Make the proper adjustments to do this and set your working directory properly.
Such changes need to be made on lines 19, 25, 28, 31, 34, and 52.

Note that the data on lines 37, 42, 46, and 49 will not be generated until some code in this file has been run.
When the data is generated, ensure that the paths on these lines are correct.

To start, run lines 1-34, and line 52. This loads in all necessary data and packages.

Next, run the code block that generates tumorMeta. This spans lines 131 to 234. If desired, change the output location for the CSV generated on line 234.
Then, ensure that the output CSV location matches the location it would be read in on line 37.

Next, run the code block that generates pedData. This spans lines 240 to 264. Change the output location on line 258 if desired.
Then, ensure that the output CSV location matches the location it would be read in on line 46.

Next, run the code block that generates cellMetaV2. This spans lines 59 to 103. If desired, change the output location for the CSV on line 95.
Then, ensure that the output CSV location matches the location it would be read in on line 42.

Finally, run the code block that generates cellData. This spans lines 117-119. If desired, change the output location for the CSV on line 119.
Then, ensure that the output CSV location matches the location it would be read in on line 49.


Now all input data for the analysis script should be ready.
Open ped_analysis_reviewed.R

To use the analysis script, first change file paths as necessary to set the working directory on line 28 and to load the data you just generated.
File path locations should be checked and changed if necessary on lines 34, 39, 43, and 46.

If this is your first time running the script, uncomment lines 254 to 257.
Make sure the file location on line 254 matches where you put the Tumor Compendium expected counts data.
Run lines 34-35 and 254-257. This will generate a smaller CSV that contains expected counts data for medulloblastoma tumor samples only.
Ensure the paths on lines 262 and 257 match. You can then re-comment lines 254 to 257. 254-257 should not need to be run again as long as the CSV it generated is present.

Ensure also that the file paths on lines 923, 1026, and 1066 all correspond to the correct files (all tumor expected counts, clinical data, and expected counts, respectively).

Throughout the entire file, ensure that PDF(), saveRDS(), jpeg(), write.table(), and any other similar functions are outputting to locations that you desire.
The simplest way to achieve this is to make "Intermediate_Data" and "Results" folders in your working directory.

Check that you have all packages required at the top of the script (lines 1-22) and install/load them if you are missing any.

Now, you should be able to run the entire analysis script.
Results will be in the results folder (or wherever else you specified), with some supplementnal files in the Intermediate_Data folder.
